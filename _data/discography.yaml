SP:
  title: "S'accommoder/Perdido"
  type: Split
  release_date: 2024-05-23
  label: ROHS! Records
  label_release_id: ROHS!049
  excerpt: >- 
    While their image remains trapped in glamourous clichés, European cities (Lisbon, Paris, London etc.) undergo post-pandemic capitalist dystopia. Their inhabitants are hindered by the wear and tear of life - unemployment, debt, poverty - while millions are pumped into tourism and foreign investment. <br/>This collaborative release by Ryefield Society and James A. McDermid takes its roots in these bittersweet places where beauty is hindered by misery, pollution and/or human contempt.<br/><br/>
    
    Many thanks James, but also to J. Nathan Dziedzic who did the artwork, to Andrea Porcu who mastered the album, and to ROHS! Records for releasing the album.<br/><br/>

  title: Artless Ostinati
  type: Album
  release_date: 2023-04-17
  label: Huinali Recordings
  label_release_id: HNL018
  excerpt: >- 
    Artless Ostinati is about never-ending worries and remaining teen dreams.<br/>
    In this first LP, Ryefield Society combines naive melodies and anxious beats to explore the feelings of adulting. An intimate portrait depicted under city lights by blurry guitars and minimal pianos.<br/>
    The album includes a featuring with long-time collaborator Scepticisme and a stunning remix by Zeze Wakamatsu.<br/>
    
    I would like to thank all the persons involved in this release. Thanks to Scepticisme and Zeze Wakamatsu for their beautiful contributions. 
    Many thanks to Javier Marimon (Off T Visuals) who did the artwork, to Mattias Fridell who mastered the album, and to Huinali Recordings for giving me the chance to release this first LP with them.<br/><br/>

  excerpt: >- 
    Composed between 2018 and 2020, The Alternative Path of Abstraction is my first EP.<br/>
    Made of electronic sounds, samples from old records and guitar chords, this project focuses on the feelings of anxiety and explores abstraction - in its multiple definitions - as a way to escape them.<br/>
    It consists of five tracks including one remix by my dear friend Scepticisme.

  title: Unsent Postcard
  album: 'Siren Songs: Solidarity with Ukraine'
  type: Compilation
  release_date: 2022-04-07
  label: Mailbox Records
  label_release_id: 
  excerpt: >-
    "Unsent Postcard" is part of the compilation Siren Songs released by Mailbox Records in April 2022. 
    On the 3rd March 2022, James McDermid received the following email through Bandcamp: "Hello, I'm Stas Teterevlev - I live in a boat on an island in the middle of Kyiv. I really love what you do. I've been listening to your work today, it helps me a lot. I recorded this ambience and would be very happy if you would like to use it".
    The recording was the moment Russia began their assault on Kyiv/Ukraine, 24th February 2022.<br/>
    James took Stas' message to heart - flattered he'd included him amongst several other musicians he'd sent the recording to - and considered whether or not if his recording could be worked into music of my own, like he suggested. Instead James put out a call across social media for collaborators to help put together a compilation of their music that utilised the recording. Siren Songs: Solidarity With Ukraine is the result.<br/>
    Any and all donations (minus Bandcamp/PayPal/Credit Card fees) to this compilation will go directly to Sunflower of Peace: "a fundraiser to provide medical and humanitarian aid that will be used by the paramedics and doctors in the areas that are affected by the violence in Ukraine. We are acquiring and distributing first-aid backpacks, medicine, medical instruments, and other means of survival that are saving hundreds of lives."

  title: Home Outside
  album: Music for Another Sky
  type: Compilation
  release_date: 2021-01-25
  label: Mailbox Records
  label_release_id: 
  excerpt: >-
    "Home Outside" is part of the compilation Music for Another Sky released by Mailbox Records in January 2021. 
    This 32-track compilation has been put together in order to raise awareness and/or raise money for the UK charity, Refuge. This means 100% of proceeds from all sales will go to them (after the standard deductions from Bandcamp and PayPal). <br/>
    It was 1971 when Refuge opened the world’s first safe house, so this year marks the 50th year they’ve been helping women and children escape a life of abuse and violence; the first to make the point that violence in the home was no longer “a private matter” for society to simply turn a blind eye. <br/>
    Refuge’s reputation for helping vulnerable people comes at a time where domestic violence (globally) has increased recently by nearly 30%, according to the UN; this is due in no small part to the government lockdowns brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. Victims often now find themselves under constant surveillance by their abuser where phones are regularly checked and/or confiscated, making it harder than ever to call or text for help.
