New release: Working in Loneliness, a compilation.

Working in Loneliness tries to be <!--more-->an overview of French one wo.man bands. Presenting songs by artists with various approaches, including both DIY nerds and studio experts. All the benefits are donated to Le refuge (www.le-refuge.org) which takes care of young rejected LGBTQI+ persons.

You'll find my track Oxytocin as the opening song:
