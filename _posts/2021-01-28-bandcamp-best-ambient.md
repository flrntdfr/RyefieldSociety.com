"Music for Another Sky" has just been featured on Bandcamp's January 2021 Best Ambient Music list. <!--more-->Many thanks to Arielle Gordon for showing appreciation of my track Home Outside. 

> This is a compilation from the relatively new [Mailbox Records](https://mailbox-label.bandcamp.com/music), a Bristol label founded by the ambient and drone musician [James A. McDermid](https://jamcdermid.bandcamp.com/), along with Inês Ourives Delgado. The label has already built a modest catalogue of delicate instrumental and electronic compositions, but *Music for Another Sky* is arguably its most impressive release to date. Featuring new work from a broad range of international artists—including frequent Montréal-based collaborator [anthéne](https://anthene.bandcamp.com/), British [Disintegration State](https://disintegrationstate.bandcamp.com/) label head [Steve Hadfield](https://stevehadfield.bandcamp.com/), and Nairobi-based field recordings wiz [KMRU](https://kmru.bandcamp.com/)—the compilation is a fundraiser for the UK domestic violence charity [Refuge](https://www.refuge.org.uk/). The compilation takes its name from an Emily Dickinson poem about imagining a serene world. The radiating tones of [Ryefield Society](https://ryefieldsociety.bandcamp.com/)’s “Home Outside” and JARR’s “An Echo in Her Skin” seem to embody that serenity.
