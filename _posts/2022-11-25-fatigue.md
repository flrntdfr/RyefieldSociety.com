Toronto-based label Imaginary North just released *Ambient Guitar Chronicles*, a guitar-only ambient compilation.<!--more--><br/>
I had the pleasure to contribute the track *Fatigue*, which you can hear below. I really enjoyed the challenge of using only guitar to compose and perform this piece, although it was somehow frustrating. Many thanks to Daniel (Kilometre Club) for curating this compilation. I am very happy to have a track in this nice release.<br/>
