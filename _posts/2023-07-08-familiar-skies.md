The Chinese label [Jyugam](https://jyugam.bandcamp.com) has just released a compilation entitled "場所精神 / Genius Loci Vol. 1", in which I had the pleasure to contribute a piece.<!--more--><br/>

The compilation includes eleven tracks that cover a large scope of electronic music styles. It was mastered by Florence Tang and its artwork was designed by [maf](https://maf-works.com/). 

The track is called "Familiar Skies (Anemoia)" and is a very personal one, since it tries to put sounds on the comfortable sensations I associate to the place I grew up in. This dub-influenced downtempo track is a contemplative piece that aims to reflect the beauty of familiar landcapes and a feeling of imaginary nostalgia.
