I am very happy to announce the release of a new track. The Chinese label [Indefinite Pitch](https://indefinitepitch.bandcamp.com/) has kindly invited me to contribute a piece to their compilation "Selected Works. Series 3". <!--more--><br/>

It is a particular honor for me to be part of this release, as I had really liked the previous volume in this compilation series. 
The compilation includes twenty tracks exploring deep and ambient techno territories. It was mastered by J. David Lucio S. and its artwork was designed by Mark Wagner.
    
The new track is called "Another Escape" and reflects on introspective night walks chasing clearer skies in dark industrial cities. With this intimate track, Ryefield Society explores new territories by blending bass music elements into guitar- and synth-driven melancholia.
