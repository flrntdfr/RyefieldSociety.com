Ryefield Society is a solo electronic music project focused on ambient textures and melancholy. 

Originally from France but now based in Cologne (Germany), Fantin (he/him/his) started producing music at the age of 16, in 2010. After a decade spent exploring different musical genres and approaches - including electronics, post-rock and black metal -, he released his <a href='https://ryefieldsociety.com/release/the-alternative-path-of-abstraction'>first EP</a> on Spleencore Records in 2020. 
In 2021, Ryefield Society contributed to the compilation <a href='https://ryefieldsociety.com/release/home-outside'>Music For Another Sky</a> curated by label Mailbox Records. 

A first album should be released in 2022.
