Ryefield Society is a solo electronic music project focused on ambient textures and melancholy. 

Originally from France but now based in Cologne (Germany), Fantin started producing music at the age of 16, in 2010. After a decade spent exploring different musical approaches and genres - including electronics, post-rock and black metal -, he released his <a href='https://ryefieldsociety.com/release/the-alternative-path-of-abstraction'>first EP</a> on Spleencore Records in 2020. 
Recently, Ryefield Society contributed to the compilations <a href='https://ryefieldsociety.com/release/home-outside'>Music For Another Sky</a> and <a href='https://mailbox-label.bandcamp.com/album/siren-songs-solidarity-with-ukraine'>Siren Songs: Solidarity With Ukraine</a>, both curated by James McDermid and released by the label Mailbox. 

A first album should be released in 2022.
